// CMPS-012B • Program 5 • Hashing and Spell Checking
/* 1.  Overview
In this assignment you will implement a spelling checker that uses a
hash table to look up words in a dictionary.  Collision resolution
will be done by separate chaining.  A scanner generated by flex will
be used to extract words form the files to be checked.
