//CMPS-012B • Program 3 • Binary Search Trees
/* 1.  Overview
In this assignment you will implement a binary search tree data
structure that will support airport code queries.  Your program will
not attempt to create a balanced tree, since that is beyond the scope
of this course, but will rather depend on input being suitably
ordered.
