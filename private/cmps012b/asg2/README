/*
In this assignment you will implement a singly-linked linear list of
words to implement a cross referencing utility.  The words will be
keys, and each will contain a queue of line numbers.  The queue will
also be implemented as a linear linked list.  Your queue operations
must run in $ O ( 1 ) $ time, but your map (dictionary) operations
will run in $ O ( n ) $ time instead of the usually-expected $ O ( log
sub 2 n ) $ time.  Thus, if your entire program scans $n$ words in a
file, it will run at speed $ O ( n sup 2 ) $ instead of $ O ( n log
sub 2 n ) $ time.
